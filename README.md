# State Estimation Filters

## Introduction
Implementation of different kinds of Linear/Nonlinear filters in MATLAB such as Kalman Filter (KF), Particle Filter (PF) in a graduate course " Estimation for Robotic Navigation ".

## Overview of the Repository
In this repo, you'll find :
* `TD_EKF`: Code for solving an assignment using EKFs (check `TD_KF_EKF.pdf` for details).
* `TD_PF`: Code for solving an assignment using PFs (check `TD_PF_EN.pdf` for details).
* `TD_CI-2`: Code for solving an assignment using CI (check `TD_CIF.pdf` for details).
* `FUNCTIONS`: For data reading, and mathematical operations.

## Getting Started
1.  Clone our repo: `git clone https://github.com/HusseinLezzaik/State-Estimation-Filters.git`
2.  Install [MATLAB](https://fr.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html).
3.  Run `Matlab-code.m` to implement the algorithm you want.
